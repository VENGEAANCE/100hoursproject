Welcome to OpenAi Image Generator app that uses the OpenAI Dall-E 2 API to generate images based on text input! This app allows you to enter a prompt and generate an image based on that prompt. Here's how to use it:

Getting Started
To use this app, you'll need to have an API key for the OpenAI Dall-E 2 API. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for one at https://beta.openai.com/.

Once you have an API key, you'll need to set it as an environment variable on your system.

Replace your_api_key with your actual API key. This will set the environment variable for your current session.

# Using the App
To use the app, simply enter a prompt in the text field and select a size for the generated image. Then click the "Generate Image" button. The app will send a request to the OpenAI Dall-E 2 API to generate an image based on your prompt, and it will display the generated image on the page.

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using the app, check the following:

-  Make sure that you have set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable correctly.
-  Make sure that you have an active internet connection.
-  If you see an error message, try checking the browser's console for more information about the issue.

# Optimizations
